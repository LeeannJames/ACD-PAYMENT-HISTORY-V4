# ACD PAYMENT HISTORY

## Overview

This is the ACD PAYMENT HISTORY application - a Flask-based web application that scrapes specific payment data columns (Date, Pen, Principal, CBU, CBU withdraw, Collector) from loan information web pages and provides the extracted data in a downloadable Excel format. The application features the official ACD (Audit and Compliance Department) logo and branding, uses BeautifulSoup for web scraping, pandas for data manipulation, and Bootstrap for the frontend interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a simple Flask web application architecture with a modular design:

- **Frontend**: Bootstrap-based responsive web interface with custom styling
- **Backend**: Flask web server with session management
- **Data Processing**: BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and pandas for data manipulation
- **File Handling**: Temporary file generation for Excel downloads

## Key Components

### 1. Web Application (app.py)
- **Flask Application**: Main web server handling routes and requests
- **Session Management**: Uses Flask sessions with configurable secret key
- **Error Handling**: Flash messaging system for user feedback
- **URL Validation**: Built-in URL format validation using urlparse

### 2. Web Scraper (scraper.py)
- **PaymentDataScraper Class**: Handles web scraping operations for specific columns
- **Target Columns**: Date, Receipt No, Principal, Pen, CBU, CBU withdraw, Collector
- **Calculated Columns**: 
  - Principal_PassBook & Principal_Variance (for Principal + Pen calculations)
  - CBU_PassBook & CBU_Variance (for CBU + CBU withdraw calculations)
- **Smart Table Detection**: Identifies payment transaction tables specifically
- **Column Mapping**: Maps various header formats to target columns including Receipt No
- **HTTP Session Management**: Persistent session with realistic user-agent headers
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and exception handling

### 3. Frontend Interface
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap styling
  - `index.html`: Main URL input form
  - `preview.html`: Data preview and download interface
- **Static Assets**: 
  - Custom CSS for enhanced styling and animations
  - JavaScript for form validation and interactive features

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User submits a URL through the web form
2. **URL Validation**: Backend validates URL format and accessibility
3. **Web Scraping**: PaymentDataScraper extracts payment data using multiple methods
4. **Data Processing**: Extracted data is structured and stored in session
5. **Preview Display**: User can preview extracted data in a table format
6. **Excel Generation**: Data is converted to Excel format using pandas
7. **File Download**: Temporary Excel file is served for download

## External Dependencies

### Python Packages
- **Flask**: Web framework for the application
- **BeautifulSoup4**: HTML parsing and web scraping
- **requests**: HTTP client for web requests
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and Excel file generation
- **werkzeug**: WSGI utilities and proxy handling

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework with dark theme
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library
- **Custom CSS/JS**: Enhanced user experience and interactions

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for flexible deployment:

- **Development**: Direct Flask development server (main.py)
- **Production Ready**: ProxyFix middleware for reverse proxy compatibility
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-based secret key management
- **Session Management**: Configurable session handling for user data persistence
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system for debugging and monitoring

### Key Deployment Considerations
- Secret key should be set via SESSION_SECRET environment variable
- Application runs on host 0.0.0.0:5000 by default
- Debug mode enabled for development environments
- Proxy-aware configuration for deployment behind reverse proxies

### Scalability Notes
- Stateless design except for temporary session data
- Temporary file cleanup handled automatically
- Memory-efficient streaming for large datasets
- Session-based data storage for multi-step workflows
